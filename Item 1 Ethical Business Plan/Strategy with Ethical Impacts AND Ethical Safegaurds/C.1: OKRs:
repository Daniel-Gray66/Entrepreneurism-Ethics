  One objective for Life Lens is to achieve an 85% accuracy rate in providing correct public 
information about the person photographed. We acknowledge that some individuals may resemble
others, potentially leading to incorrect information being accessed. To mitigate this, users
will be able to view a publicly available photo of the identified person, allowing them to 
confirm if the retrieved information matches the individual they photographed. Additionally,
we aim to enhance our recognition capabilities by improving the software. A key result is to 
reduce identification errors to less than 15% by the end of the third quarter through software
enhancements and user feedback.

  Another objective we have is making the life lens app accesable nationwide. We believe that this
product would be useful anywhere in the world and we want to first start here in the states.  We're expecting 
to have to have completed a fully functional prototype of the app by Q2 of our first year. We also
want to expand our user base to at least one hundred thousand people within the first two
years. We believe that this platform has the potential to have exponential growth assuming it picks up tobeing with
Here at Life Lens we realize that legality should be our number one concern. In order to do that, we will partner
with at least 5 federal or state agencies within the first year of being live. 

  Another OKR we want to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access to the app. We are 
going to do this by maintaining a zero-breach record during the first 3 years of operation.
We will implement a multi factor authentication for all app functionalities by the end of 
the first year. 

  Another objective of Life Lens is to address and resolve any legal concerns related to the use of consumer data. 
Ensuring that all sourced information is publicly available or otherwise legally accessible is critical to 
delivering reliable results to users. It is essential for the company to avoid unethical practices such 
as using private information that should remain confidential. Upholding the right to privacy is our top priority 
throughout the development and deployment of this product.
