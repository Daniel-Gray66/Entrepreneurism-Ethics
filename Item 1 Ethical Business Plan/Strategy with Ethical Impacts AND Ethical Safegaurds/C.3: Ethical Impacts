  The ethical impacts of our first OKR could be that the app has access and displays sensitive public 
information (e.g., criminal records, addresses, employment) about individuals. Even if the data is publicly
available, automating access through a photo recognition system amplifies privacy risks. There is also a risk of misidentifying 
individuals, particularly in cases where they might look very simillar. This can lead to incorrect data being displayed, which
could damage reputations or even make innocent people look guilty.

 Regarding ethical impacts about expanding the app nationwide we might face problems surrounded with  
 with various state and federal laws, especially concerning data privacy. 

  The OKR promising perfect data security with ahving no breaches is the first year seems very impossible to do with the rise of data beraches 
  currently in the world. It's possible to achieve this objective in the time period given, but making it a promise could definitely lead to issues
  with clinte trust issues if it were to happen. Multi-factor authentication could exclude certain groups from using the app, particularly those with disabilities or 
  individuals with limited phone service.

problems with displaying all the information is the person can sinply not allow us to display their informmation to others. This is a 
problem beacause if said infomration is displayed even through the person didn't concent to it could lead to many legal problems down the 
line. Another problem may arise with displaying information that wasn't even public to begin with. We need to make sure that all the information we 
gather is legitament, gathered legally, and the person is okay with having the infomation displayed.
