  For objective one we will determine determinating the metric in which its 
succesful is pretty straight forward. We will implement a feature whether where the 
user can tell us whether or not the infomration provided is really the same person. We will 
constantly improving the Ai face recognition software so that this issue slowly gets better overtime.

  There really isn't a metric for the app being accesable nationwide, but I guess we can try to implement features such that 
no state feels like they need to ban it. These features could include, making sure not to sell private data, making sure the data provided is correct,
and adding some user survey to help us identify the problems or areas where which we could improve. 
 
  The way we're going to measure the success of data security will be simply knowing which accounts have been compromised in our system.
We will build a system that notifies when a possible hacker is trying to get into someone elses account taht isnt theres. 
We will be implenting a chaing password policy every couple of months or so, just to make sure that if someone gets a password it wouldn't really matter in the long term.
Or perhaps we implent a system where a password isn't even an option and the only way to sign in would be through fingerr print.


Our metric regarind legality and legal security will be simply listing all federal, and legal agencies that we are currently partnered with. 
Showing this in app, would convery the fact that our services are legal and that all infomration is safe on our app.
We can measure the amount of incidents related to data privacy and calcualte the percentage of legal reviews that pass without regarding major changes or penalties.
